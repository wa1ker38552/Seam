In addition to providing insurance on more than 160 different crops under a variety of plans, we deliver technology and services designed to aid our agents - together we protect America's farmers, growers and ranchers.

Since 1980, RCIS has helped reshape the privatized crop insurance business by offering a comprehensive line of insurance products and services to meet the unique requirements of producers, adding crops as new varieties emerge and developing new types of coverage when needed. In addition to mobile applications to enable our agents to calculate and track quotes, APH records, acreage reports, and notice of loss, our mapping services have also been updated with the addition of Farm Maps and we support Precision Farming – to lessen the work for our farmers.

RCIS also offers a wide range of private products including a diverse selection of named peril coverages available to MPCI policyholders. Named peril polices help fill a gap in MPCI coverage and typically insure a single peril like rain or freeze to help producers cover exposure.  A few examples include: Late Plant and Replant options; in California Citrus Fruit Freeze, Contingent Business Interruption, Grape Freeze (also available in OR) and Raisin Reconditioning.

When areas around the nation are exposed to the wrath of mother nature, RCIS is there to help in the aftermath by providing Crisis Response Teams. In areas where claim volume is high, handpicked adjusters, with experience in the crops and type of peril they'll be adjusting, are dispatched to help producers with claims – recognizing their need for a diligent and rapid response.

RCIS currently conducts business in all 50 states.

The same entrepreneurial spirit that led Horace Fishback Sr. to open his first check-cashing station in Brookings, SD in 1880 drives us toward our vision: To grow a diversified independent financial corporation that excels in delivering community banking services and providing niche products nationwide.

We are proud to be a family- and employee-owned community bank.  Our 700+ employees take pride in our Be the 1 Service Culture principles - and it shows!  We offer all of the strength and capabilities you might expect from a big-bank, but still have the flexibility and responsiveness of an independent local bank.

A self-supporting insurance carrier, NYSIF operates without taxpayer funding. 

In addition to workers' compensation insurance, NYSIF provides disability benefits coverage for off-the-job injuries to more than 61,000 New York employers. In 2018, NYSIF added Paid Family leave as a component of its disability benefits product, providing New Yorkers with job-protected, paid time away from work to care for their families.",1914,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/67537f4045069e0001795bb8/picture

As a graduate of Lehigh University, with a Master's of Computer Engineering, John decided to use his technology expertise to revolutionize one of the least technologically advanced industries in the world, the insurance industry.

We developed our first product in 2005 with the launch of iWebQuotes.com, an insurance marketing website. The purpose of the service was to connect clients looking for health and life insurance with experienced agents who could review the options with them.

As iWebQuotes.com became successful, it quickly became evident that there was a void in insurance sales technology. Agents needed a technology which could facilitate selling insurance to clients over the phone and internet. This led to our next launch of American Insurance Organization (AIO), in 2007. AIO partners carriers and brokers to expedite the sales process.

Ideal Concepts launched SalesRadix, our newest marketing and sales solution technology in 2014. For the first time in the insurance industry, SalesRadix provides a turnkey sales solution. Our technology gives agents the highest quality leads, an advanced marketing system and a customer relationship manager. We believe that an agent should focus on what they are best at, which is sales, while we manage all of the administrative work, marketing, and technology for them.

With that in mind, we launched our own private health exchange in 2015. Our private exchange offers clients and brokers the opportunity to buy and sell ACA compliant plans, along with supplemental coverage like dental, vision, accident and critical illness policies from one source.

As we continue to grow in an ever complex industry, you can be sure that Ideal Concepts will continue to develop technology, products, and solutions, in order to simplify the insurance industry.",2005,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/675e5ef333bd7c0001bc3c69/picture

Committed to leading the way
We're Washington's first not-for-profit to serve Apple Health members.

In 1992, Washington's low-cost clinics (known as Community Health Centers) realized too many people were being neglected by traditional insurance. They got together and started Community Health Plan of Washington.

CHPW is the state's first not-for-profit managed care plan founded by Community Health Centers.
Today, we're still the only not-for-profit to provide managed care to Apple Health members.
Always working to improve our services, we expanded to cover Medicare patients in 2007.
Committed to Washington's families
We treat you how we'd want to be treated.

We strive to make CHPW a home for all our members. Home means different things to different people, but it starts with being understood, respected, and cared for.

Juggling your family's health care needs can feel like a full-time job. But we're on your team, helping you access all the services, therapies and solutions you need for their whole health. No matter what language a member speaks, we offer translation services.
We provide access to high-quality medical services for everyone, regardless of ability to pay.
Together, with our family of Community Health Centers, we empower members with services that go beyond traditional health care (like food, housing, and transportation assistance).
Committed to Washington's communities
We're here for Washington's residents, because we are Washington residents.

You'll see us around Washington at your community events, on the bus, or even at the PTA meeting. Our CHPW staff are your neighbors here in Washington.",1992,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6753518da0c49200018aef33/picture

The time has never been better to start selling final expense insurance. The market has seen unprecedented growth and doesn't show any signs of stopping.

Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company was founded in 1963 — a time when final expense insurance claims could take several months to be paid to policyholders. Meanwhile, the concept of fast overnight claims payment and 24-hour service for both agents and customers was more fiction than fact. As such, our founding mission for our company and our Funeral Advantage Program for seniors was to set a new bar for prompt, friendly, and accurate service in the life insurance industry.

Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an A- (Excellent) rating with A.M. Best, an organization that evaluates the financial strength of insurance companies. We've also received hundreds of positive reviews over the years from Funeral Advantage policyholder families who have experienced our fast claims service.

Commonly referred to as burial insurance or funeral insurance, Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company provides final expense life insurance quotes for people looking to protect their families from rising funeral costs. As a family-owned company, we provide the old-fashioned, personalized service you deserve.

By 1945, our company moved beyond our Iowa borders to do business in a second state, Minnesota, rapidly followed by more states. And today, Wellabe's six insurance companies are licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia and are recognized by AM Best as having excellent financial strength. 

Mr. Powell's vision was to create a company founded on the principal of caring. While we have seen tremendous growth over the years, that same caring attitude has carried on to today and will continue to carry on for the next 100 years.

We are in a people helping people business, and our entire team is dedicated to always being here for our customers. That's actually where the name Wellabe comes from – the phrase ""we'll always be."" We'll always be here for our customers, fulfilling our promises and helping them be well.

They had a clear vision, to create a model that would bring managed care to underserved populations in the same way that federally qualified health centers bring them medical services.

Over the organization's first 17 years, CHNCT transformed from a small group's dream into a premier health plan, recognized on both local and national levels. The leadership and staff of CHNCT had a passion to serve Connecticut's population, unmatched by any organization. During this time, CHNCT grew from an underdog company into the largest managed care organization in the state, serving over 300,000 members.

From the beginning, people have been at the core of the work that CHNCT does. Person-centeredness is the guiding principle that we follow when working with members and healthcare providers. It is a way of thinking and doing things that sees the whole person. It is an approach that brings the person into the planning, developing, and monitoring of care to ensure that it meets the person's needs.

After announcing it would move to an innovative self-insured administrative services organization (ASO) model, in 2012 the Department of Social Services selected CHNCT as the sole medical ASO. CHNCT has helped the state to improve health outcomes for members, reduce costs for both the State of Connecticut and healthcare providers, and improve transparency and accountability. Under the ASO model, CHNCT proudly serves over 800,000 members.",1995,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/67517551bb16f70001b6060f/picture

Our history dates back to 1905 when Herman Stufflebeam started an abstract company in Bingham County, Idaho.  Herman owned and operated the company for 37 years and was succeeded by his wife Ruth Hilliard Stufflebeam who was the President for the following 27 years. Ruth retired in 1969 and Dwain Hilliard Stufflebeam, the founder's son, succeeded her.

Upon being named as president, Dwain immediately began an aggressive project to expand the company's footprint outside of Bingham County and into Southeastern Idaho and later Montana and Washington.

In 2012, Dwain retired as Chief Executive Officer but remains actively involved as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Following in his father's footsteps, Quinn Stufflebeam began working in the family business at a young age. After earning a Bachelor's degree in Management from the University of Utah and a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Arizona, Quinn returned to manage a county office in Twin Falls Idaho. He went on to become the Idaho State President and currently serves as Chief Executive Officer.

Quinn has continued to follow the expansion plan and in 2012 the company broadened its footprint into Wyoming.

Today, Title Financial Corporation consists of five wholly-owned subsidiaries: First American Title Company, Inc., First American Title Company of Montana, Inc., Insured Titles, Title Financial Corporation of Wyoming, and Title Financial Specialty Services. 

Title Financial Corporation remains a family-owned regional company and local commitment is key in our organization. At Title Financial Corporation, we are committed to unrivaled Customer Service.

This Foundation has raised over $2.6 Million since inception and has received the National Community Bank Service Award and the Gift of the Heart Philanthropy Award. In addition, Lincoln Savings Bank has been awarded America's SBDC Small Business Champion Award in 2017 for support of Iowa's businesses. 

To better serve our customers and earn their business, we offer the convenience of mobile banking and mobile bill pay, the innovative technology of a personal financial management system, and the drive to ensure they are given the best care in all facets of their finances- all while providing the personal touch that can only be provided by a community bank. Experience over a century's worth of our rich history and the many new and exciting stories being written right now and into the future.

In addition to the promotion of each credit union's unique products and services, The Family Security Plan offers supplemental insurance products as a benefit of credit union membership. Our product offering includes individual Whole Life Insurance, Disability Income Insurance, Critical Illness Insurance and Accident Insurance.

Our predecessor organizations date back in the late 1940's when RBG's founder, Pat Rogers, decided to enter the small employer group insurance business. Being an agent himself, he also knew that agents were going to need a marketing organization to help them bring specialized knowledge and service to their clients in the increasingly complex area of health benefits.

Our first insurance carrier relationship began with Principal Financial Group. This relationship thrives today. Regionally, we enjoy strategic relationships with Aetna, certain Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, HealthNet, United Health Care, Humana, and Assurant Health. Today Rogers Benefit Group helps agents service more than 40,000 groups who pay more than $2.5 billion in annual premium.

Rogers Benefit Group is committed to fast, accurate response to an agent or employer when addressing their group insurance needs. It is from our Midwest roots that one can expect a no-nonsense, straightforward, competent approach to groups of any size.

Our Geography
We are currently located in over 30 states with 40 offices. This geographic spread lends itself well to the opportunity of assisting agents with groups having multiple locations. It also makes us the oldest and largest General Agent in the United States as measured by locations and, more importantly, premium in force. 

What's Really Important
Agents tell us that our greatest value is in the quoting and underwriting processes. Our mission is to help agents get business, get groups rated correctly, get them enrolled efficiently and accurately, and to help reduce their efforts in underwriting.

The founding group envisioned an independent firm that gave each Representative vision, values and voice.

Today, NEXT Financial Group, Inc. (""NEXT""​), Member FINRA/SIPC operates under the same principles on which it was founded. It has grown from $4 million in gross revenue to more than $127 million while providing Investment Advisor Representatives with significant intellectual and capital resources. The company is owned by its Investment Advisor Representatives and staff, and no shareholder owns more than 10 percent of the company. The Board of Directors is made up of five Office of Jurisdictions (""OSJs""​), and all committees within NEXT are run by NEXT Investment Advisor Representatives.

An eight-time Broker-Dealer of the Year award-winning* firm, NEXT believes that its strength lies in its Investment Advisor Representatives. In that spirit, NEXT encourages vision and empowers them to take control over their own destinies by giving them a voice, equity and revenue in everything they create.

Since 2016, NEXT implemented the NEXT Select Program with Pershing, LLC and Lockwood. This fee-based platform was created to not only comply with the Department of Labor (""DOL""​) rule, but to meet Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""​) investment advisor rules and regulations. Additionally, it was designed to more efficiently manage money and assists with streamlining client communications and fee-based strategies. 
 
We're a community of individuals who discuss, share and inspire each other. We hold a shared value of outstanding customer service and provide our Representatives the support they need to successfully grow and run their businesses. We invite you to take a closer look at how experience, knowledge and teamwork can make NEXT a truly unmatched broker-dealer.

*Based on a poll of Registered Representatives conducted by Investment Advisor magazine, Broker-dealers rated highest by their Representatives are awarded ""Broker-Dealer (B-D) of the Year.""​",1999,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/6753b6b682ee480001833c3a/picture

With a team of over 880 employees, and a network of over 1,400 independent agents, NYCM is dedicated to providing superior service and a quality customer experience.

Our story began in Edmeston, NY – a tiny rural town known for its agricultural community – when one farmer lost everything in a fire. Realizing that the town needed to be better prepared for the future, 27 businessmen and residents came together to pool money and protect one another from fires and lightning, officially establishing the New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Company under founder VanNess D. Robinson in 1899.

We are a family founded and run company and believe in staying true to our small-town roots. Over 120 years later, we're still operating in our original town of Edmeston, NY and have expanded to include three additional offices in Sherburne, Orchard Park and Canajoharie, further investing ourselves in New York State and our local communities. 

We are also highly invested in our 900+ employees. We know that our best work comes from an inspired internal culture and our drive to succeed as a team. 

Between our employee base and a network of over 1,200 independent agents, NYCM Insurance is proud to service over 525,000 insureds. Our insurance lines include Home, Auto, Umbrella, Commercial and more. 

NYCM Insurance is proud to work with various partners to offer additional types of coverage for many areas of your life including special events, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, bicycles, yachts, collector cars and more. These partnerships help us ensure that you and yours are always protected no matter what life throws at you.

At the end of the day, our reason for doing business is the same as it was 120 years ago. We believe in providing genuine care; so that we can all have hope for a better tomorrow and the courage to persevere.",1899,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/675386db368a850001ae8f7d/picture
